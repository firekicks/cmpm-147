Infinity
I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a vast, dynamic ecosystem where life and nature are ever-evolving.

Variation in Space
As the audience browses my world, they’ll see variations in background textures, bird species, and weather patterns, creating a unique and evolving experience beyond what’s initially visible on the screen.

Variations in Key
Different worlds will have different environmental textures, patterns, and bird behaviors based on their unique seeds, making each world stand out in terms of appearance and ecosystem dynamics.

Signs of Life
Clicking tiles causes rain and influences the behavior of nearby birds, while the passage of time results in the foliage offset changing, more birds being added to the world, and their flocking behaviors evolving.
