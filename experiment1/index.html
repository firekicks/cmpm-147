				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I'm trying to generate vegetarian dishes that are packed with flavor with this generator.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I started off looking at the template provided to us and coming up with generator ideas. I then thought of vegetarian dishes as that hits home with me. After that I had to come up the filler words to use. Next was getting glitch to the experiment index.html file. I followed the template that was provided to me which included changing the div of the html to add the button and changinf the main with my code from glitch. The last thing I did was changed the glitch code to use jQuery instead of the DOM elements.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this code by myself and followed the template given to us by the professor. I struggled with the button and implementing it in html, but after some time of staring in my screen, I was able to figure it out. The template was really helpful and easy to follow, hence why I didn't face much difficulties. The project was really fun in terms of messing around with recipes and vegetarian dishes. I hope this can show people that there are alternate food options that are tasty.</p>
