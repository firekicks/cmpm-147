Infinity:
I used the infinite extent of my world to represent the vastness and unpredictability of nature, particularly the desert landscape. Just as the real world contains endless variations and unexpected occurrences, my digital desert is vast, stretching beyond the screen's edges into an expansive virtual terrain.

Variation in Space:
As the audience browses my world, they'll see shifting sand dunes, tiles that vary in color and texture, and the occasional cactus or oasis. These elements create a dynamic environment that continues to change even as you interact with it, reflecting the desert's ever-changing nature.

Variations in Key:
Different worlds will have different arrangements of dunes, colors, and features like cacti and oases. This variability in world generation ensures that each desert feels unique, offering distinct landscapes, plant life, and details based on the key used to generate them.

Signs of Life:
Clicking tiles causes oasis waters to appear in a neighboring tile, creating a brief but visible sign of life. Meanwhile, the passage of time results in cacti sprouting and growing until they fade away. These transient signs of life mirror the delicate balance found in real deserts, where life exists in dynamic harmony with its surroundings.
