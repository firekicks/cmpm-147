				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In summary, this code appears to be implementing a dynamic, interactive desert tile map. Tiles can show variations in sand color, randomly spawn cacti, or reveal oases when clicked. The design combines procedural generation (via noise functions and random events) with interactive elements like clicking to create a visually interesting and engaging desert scene. The trees are meant to have fruit on them and bugs flying around them to make them more lively.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The desert landscape is procedurally generated using a hash-based seed, which initializes noise and random number generators for deterministic variations. Tiles can spawn cacti with a 2% chance, which have a timer for their presence. Clicking on a tile triggers a visual effect where an oasis water feature appears, unless there's a cactus on it. The shifting sand effect is achieved by incrementing a global duneOffset variable, which modifies the noise pattern for each tile's sand color. The map maintains global states for cactus timers and click durations, supporting interactive gameplay elements. On click there will be a little oasis that spawns in the desert.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was my first attempt at making the generator and it was the longest. The other two were much easier after some time. I did enjoy this process and it was fun figuring the logic of how to implement the oasis and cacti. This assignment was done alone and I used ChatGPT.
