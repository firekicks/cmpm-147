Colors:
The color palette I chose is directly inspired by the hues and gradients seen in the inspiring image. From the soft pink at the top of the sky to the deep blue at its base, the colors capture the backdrop of the original scene. The mountains are painted in a range of purples and blues, each layer darker, adding depth.

Primitives:
In making the elements of the scene, I utilized basic geometric primitives. Ellipses represent the sun and stars, creating points of light that attract the viewer's eye. Triangles form the tree tops, simplifying complex forms into recognizable silhouettes, while rectangles serve as the trunks, grounding the trees within the landscape.

Polygons:
Custom-shaped polygons are essential for adding intricate detail and texture. Using the beginShape(), endShape(), and vertex() functions, I crafted jagged mountain outlines and a dynamically undulating horizon line. These polygons carefully emulate the natural irregularities found in landscapes, reflecting form present in the  image.

Generativity:
I infused the scene with elements of generativity, ensuring that each rendering is unique. Stars twinkle at varying intensities, and the placement of trees subtly shifts with each iteration. This randomness adds an element of unpredictability.

Life:
The life of the design is embodied by the glowing sun. I programmed the sun to glow dynamically, changing its intensity and size based on trigonometric calculations. This not only gives the sun a pulsating life of its own but also enhances the overall atmospheric effect, making the sun a central, lively character in the scene.
