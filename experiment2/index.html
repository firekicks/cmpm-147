				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal was to recreate the landscape image I chose. In his second example the professor went over how to break up an image and do it part by part. That is the same approach I took when I started coding this project.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In my p5.js script, I began by configuring a canvas to fit within a specified container and set the color mode to RGB for various elements like the sky, mountains, and trees. I also created a separate graphics layer specifically for the stars, allowing me to animate them without affecting other static elements in the scene. This approach helps in optimizing performance. In the draw function, I make sure everything runs quickly and smoothly, I only redraw things that really need it, like the gradient in the sky, the clouds, and the mountains. I also make sun glow making it my "Live" feature. I use a mix of random changes and trig functions to make these effects feel natural. I've crafted detailed scenes with my drawing functionsâ€”creating rugged mountains using Perlin.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
