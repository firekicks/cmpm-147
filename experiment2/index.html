				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal was to recreate the landscape image I chose. In his second example the professor went over how to break up an image and do it part by part. That is the same approach I took when I started coding this project.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In my p5.js script, I began by configuring a canvas to fit within a specified container and set the color mode to RGB for various elements like the sky, mountains, and trees. I also created a separate graphics layer specifically for the stars, allowing me to animate them without affecting other static elements in the scene. This approach helps in optimizing performance. In the draw function, I make sure everything runs quickly and smoothly, I only redraw things that really need it, like the gradient in the sky, the clouds, and the mountains. I also make sun glow making it my "Live" feature. I use a mix of random changes and trig functions to make these effects feel natural. I've crafted detailed scenes with my drawing functions creating rugged mountains using Perlin. 
					In the code, I implemented colors, geometric primitives, custom-shaped polygons, and generativity to reflect an inspiring image. The color scheme uses gradients and shades that transition from light pink to deeper blue for the sky and progressively darker for the mountains, matching the inspiring image. I used  geometric primitives like ellipses for the sun and stars, triangles for tree tops, and rectangles for tree trunks.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> The project began with setting up a canvas where elements like the sky, mountains, and trees are rendered dynamically. Implementing features like color manipulation, animation, and responsiveness using p5.js was important to this setup. A big hurdle was keeping everything running smoothly with all the different layers of animation and interactive elements. I had to make sure the Perlin noise to make the mountains and horizon look natural. Also, I needed to make sure the interactive parts were engaging without being too much. It took a lot of tweaking to get everything just right. I was able to leverage tools like ChatGPT and the p5.js website to get over these hurdles.
