Infinity
I used the infinite extent of my world to represent the vastness and unpredictability of an ocean. This oceanic world continuously generates new features and entities as users explore it.

Variation in Space
As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see tiles of various colors that change with time and user interactions, and swimming fish that move dynamically across the screen, hinting at an ever-evolving ecosystem.

Variations in Key
Different worlds will have different aquatic terrains defined by the tile noise patterns and varying hues of blue that reflect different states of water. This variety is based on different world keys, which generate unique seeds for each world.

Signs of Life
Clicking tiles causes them to shake and change color briefly, while the passage of time results in dynamic updates such as the spawning of new fish and smooth water animations, creating a lively and interactive aquatic environment. Also on the click the earthquake effect adds a good element.
