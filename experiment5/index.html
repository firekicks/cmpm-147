				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this programming assignment, I built a generator that directly reads images, renders parameterized images, and adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Loads inspirations from an array, each consisting of a name, image URL, and credit information.</li>
                    <li>Initializes a design by setting up a canvas, displaying an image based on the chosen inspiration, and randomly creating a design object that includes color, size, and shape attributes.</li>
                    <li>Renders the design on the canvas by drawing multiple graphical elements (like circles, squares, or triangles) using colors sampled from the inspiration image at specific coordinates.</li>
                    <li>Mutates the design by altering properties such as size and position of the graphical elements to introduce variation, simulating dynamic changes or animations based on a mutation rate.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>The most interesting results from this kind of evolutionary generator are often achieved by continually adjusting the mutation rate. Set the slider to 100%, reset the generator, and then slowly drag the slider down to 1% over the period of about 30 seconds. This allows the generator to make large design changes at the start while allowing it to focus on finely details towards the end. This is best done by hand while watching the outputs improve because you can use your human judgment to decide when the generator needs to be making bigger or smaller changes to keep making progress.
                </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The hardest part of this assignmnet was the design creation. Trying to figure out how to include squares, circles, and triangles was hard and annoying. I still do not think I did as good as I could have on that. Another minor error I was getting while working on this was the resizing of the canvas for every image. It would just get smaller and smaller. I just decided to hard code the canvas sizing. Other than that, I really enjoed this project and it was one of my favorites by far.</p>
